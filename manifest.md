# Grand Architect Model — Manifesto: Issue 001 (Draft Outline)

## 1. Declaration of Scope
- This document defines the post-crisis world order as governed by dynastic continuity and concealed coordination.

## 2. Purpose of the Investigation
- To prove that systemic crises are not failures but activations — of planned control layers and wealth consolidation structures.

## 3. Working Hypotheses
- Proxies like Rothschild, Peabody are constructed agents.
- Laws are instruments of elite intent, not neutral policy.
- Crises serve as control resets — not deviations from order.

## 4. Key Evidence Types
- Dynastic ownership
- Legal immunity (BIS, SMOM, Concordats)
- Crisis profiteering and law origination
- Whistleblower accounts (Cooper, Coleman, et al.)

## 5. Simulation Layer Methodology
- Fill hidden treaty gaps by reverse-engineering effect → intent
- Connect financial flows to beneficial owners

## 6. Goals of This Document Series
- Clarify planetary ownership
- Archive suppressed evidence
- Equip public understanding of covert governance
