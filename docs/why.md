# Why I Investigate

I didn’t grow up with radical ideas. I was raised in a quiet, middle-class home shaped by fear. Fear of money, fear of failure, fear of independence. I became a pleaser—doing what was expected, not what I understood.

As a kid, I was curious. I broke things to learn how they worked. I got into computers early but had no mentors, no structure. School felt disconnected, and no one explained why it mattered. I drifted into distraction and addiction.

I believed success came from intelligence. But over time, I saw it came from access, positioning, and silence. Most people were just playing roles in systems they didn’t design and didn’t question.

I realized:
- My religion, politics, fears, and goals were inherited.
- My thoughts weren’t mine. They came from parents, media, environment.
- Obedience was rewarded more than understanding.

I stopped believing in God—not out of rebellion, but from contradiction. If there’s no divine plan, then what exists is human-made—and often by people protecting power, not truth.

I don’t believe in conspiracies. But I also don’t believe in coincidence when patterns repeat across centuries, institutions, and continents.

So I investigate:
- Who controls Earth’s assets and institutions?
- Why does global suffering persist despite abundance?
- How are dynasties, banks, and legal systems structured to preserve control?
- What gets erased or dismissed, and why?

I use AI as a tool—never as an oracle. It helps me organize thoughts, simulate perspectives, and process raw data faster. It doesn’t replace thinking. It enables deeper investigation.

This isn’t a movement. It’s a record.

I publish what I find so others can question, trace, and validate for themselves.
